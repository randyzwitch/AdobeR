# AdobeR

This project is a sketch of an idea I had about creating a commercially-supported version of an R package for the [Adobe Analytics API v2.0](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-2.0-apis). I have since decided that my personal interests lie elsewhere.

The code is released under the MIT license. Users may file issues on this repo as a means of connecting with other like-minded users, but should have no _expectation_ that the original developer will respond.

If there are users who are interested in sponsoring the development of this package, I have added a GitHub sponsors button with various levels of sponsorship. If you are a company interested in commercial sponsorship of this package, please feel free to contact me and we can discuss the details.
